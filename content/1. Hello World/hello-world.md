Looks like I am going with Ghost for my blogging needs. So far, it has everything I need. 
I am going to use this blog post for experimentation. So things might change overtime.
Things to consider:
Server Cost? Nothing is free 🤷🏼‍
Comment System? Probably won't need this. Social links should be good enough for people to connect.

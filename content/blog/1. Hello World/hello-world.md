# What's this?

This is the third iteration of my blog. (and hopefully a consistent one this time). I've finally decided to settle on using Gatsby for my main site and blog. I know, I know. I have been doing this every 4 years, rewriting entire site from scratch, spend weeks on redesign, deploy it half baked and then forget about it. But not this time. 

I've actually done a great deal of planning this time around on how I'd want to make my blog/website.

Why did I move from Ghost to Gatsby? Well, a couple of reasons actually. 

- Ghost (which I used for well over 3 years) was moving in a direction which I did not like.
- With Gatsby, I have complete control over every singe thing about this site. 
- My website and blog were running on different servers, so double the cost.
  > Fun Fact: I've spent over ~$500 in server costs and additional in domain renewal post expiry 🤷🏽‍♂️
  > That might not seem much, but for someone in a third world country, that's a lot. 💸
